            <p>The <strong>vuMind</strong> and related works website is available at www.vumind.com ("vuMind") and are owned and operated by vuMind ("us" "we" or "our"). This vuMind privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through vuMind. This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-vuMindblic information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.</p>
        
            <h2>User Consent</h2>
            <p>By accessing or otherwise using vuMind, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
            
            <h2>Regarding Children</h2>
            <p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use vuMind and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the internet. By using vuMind, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents’ permission to use vuMind.</p>
            
            <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            
            <p>In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through vuMind. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on vuMind. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of vuMind, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of vuMind, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information.

We may also collect information about you and your friends, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through vuMind in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. When you order our products or services, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for those products and services. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the vuMind community.</p>
            
            <h3>Personal Information from Other Sources</h3>
            <p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.</p>
            
            <h4>E-mail and E-mail Addresses</h4>

            <h3>Information Collected Via Technology</h3>
            
            <p>As you use vuMind, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on vuMind you clicked. This type of information is collected to make vuMind and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with vuMind to meet your special interests and needs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your comvuMindter when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access vuMind to assist with ad targeting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your comvuMindter’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your comvuMindter until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with vuMind. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. Cases may arise where in order to use our services offered through vuMind, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of vuMind may not work properly, and you may not be able to receive our services. We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on vuMind. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.</p>
