                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity" target="_blank" 
                    title="&quot;...Refers to changes in neural pathways and synapses due to changes 
                    in behavior, environment, neural processes, thinking, and emotions&quot; - 
                    Ref. Wikipedia / Pascual-Leone, A. et al.">
                    neuroplasticity</a>, the ability to train and change your brain all the way down to 
                    the level of creating neural pathways and growing the prefrontal cortex.  There 
                    are tools to upgrade your brain's native "OS and hardware," what you're bringing 
                    to every moment in life.  This is great news â€“ and vuMind shows you how.</p>

                    <p>Practice happens in the silence of your own home or out and about
                    in the midst of daily activities.  Committing to the practice means 
                    taking the reins of your mind to shape your life consciously and 
                    intentionally.  vuMind will guide you and help you discover what 
                    it means to move through life in a fuller way.</p>
