                    <h2>vuMind Video Training Series</h2> 
                    <p>You will be systematically trained in exercises that change 
                    your fundamental understanding of your mind, body, and nervous 
                    system. You will develop a toolbox that will give you the ability 
                    to control your mind and body for enhanced performance â€“ when 
                    competing, at work, at home or at play.</p>
                    <p>In these video seminars, you will be introduced to a new exercise 
                    each week and given instructions to master proper technique. You 
                    will also learn why and how these exercises profoundly alter your 
                    nervous system and mental processes in order to enhance performance.</p>
